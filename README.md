## Branch Naming Convention 🌿

To maintain consistency and organization in our development process, we follow a specific branch naming convention:

- **Feature Branches**: Begin with `feature/`, followed by a descriptive name of the feature being developed.
  Example: `feature/add-video-player`

- **Bug Fix Branches**: Begin with `bug/`, followed by a brief description of the issue being addressed.
  Example: `bug/fix-video-sync-issue`

- **Chore Branches**: Begin with `chore/`, followed by a brief description of the task or maintenance being performed.
  Example: `chore/update-dependencies`

By adhering to this convention, we can easily identify the purpose of each branch and streamline our development workflow.
